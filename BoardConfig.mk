# ROOT CAUSE FIX FOR RUN #7 — the rsync "root/vendor" collision
#
# Run #7 reached 20263/20265 and failed with:
#     could not make way for new symlink: root/vendor
#     cannot delete non-empty directory: root/vendor
#
# Without this variable, envsetup.mk leaves TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR as a
# placeholder that board_config.mk:561 resolves to "system/vendor". The
# baseline ramdisk then contains root/vendor as a SYMLINK to /system/vendor.
# Anything installing into vendor/ inside the recovery ramdisk (the
# android.hardware.boot@1.1.xml / @1.2.xml VINTF fragments that
# AB_OTA_UPDATER := true pulls in via TWRP_REQUIRED_MODULES, plus any
# .recovery HAL) turns recovery/root/vendor into a real non-empty directory,
# and the recovery packaging rsync cannot overwrite a non-empty directory with
# a symlink -> exit 23.
#
# This device HAS a real vendor partition, so "vendor" is also the correct
# value. board_config.mk:577 then sets BOARD_USES_VENDORIMAGE := true, which is
# harmless here: BUILDING_VENDOR_IMAGE additionally requires
# BOARD_VENDORIMAGE_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE, which is deliberately not set, so no
# vendor.img is built.
#
# This is exactly what the booting duchamp TWRP tree does (it sets
# TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR := vendor and therefore never hits this collision,
# even while installing the same boot/health HALs).

#
# CORRECTION to an earlier claim in this tree's history: that does NOT mean no
# modules get loaded. First-stage init loads the vendor ramdisk modules from
# /lib/modules according to modules.load / modules.load.recovery, which is the
# primary mechanism and is independent of TWRP. Cross-checked against
# jvaswb/twrp-device_infinix_X6882 and Novicio-2309/twrp-android_device_tecno_LG7n:
# both ship their modules in recovery/root/lib/modules with a modules.load and
# set no TW_LOAD_VENDOR_MODULES at all.
#
# TWRP's own loader is therefore supplementary. It is enabled here as belt and
# braces for the four modules added from stock odm_dlkm, which are also present
# in modules.load.recovery; a second insmod attempt just returns EEXIST.
#
# Touch firmware is deliberately NOT shipped. Our driver is the flash-resident
# SPI variant (focaltech_ft3683g.ko, built from .../focaltech/ft3683g_spi/), and
# its firmware requests exist only for FW upgrade and factory-test INI paths
# (fts_get_fw_file_via_request_firmware, fts_test_get_ini_via_request_firmware).
# X6882 ships odm/firmware blobs because its driver is
# focaltech_noflash_common.ko, which must upload firmware on every boot. Placing
# a firmware file where a flash-resident FTS driver can find it risks an
# auto-upgrade on probe, and flashing touch firmware from recovery can brick the
# digitizer.
